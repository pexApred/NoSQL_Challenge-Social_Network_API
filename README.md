# NoSQL_Challenge-Social_Network_API [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. Built with the latest technologies, Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM

The goal of this project is to understand how to build and structure an API because the foundation of these applications is data.

The application satifies the following user story and acceptance criteria:

AS A social media startup

I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database

SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

GIVEN a social network API

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database

WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia

THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
